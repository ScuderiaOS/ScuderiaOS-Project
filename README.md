**ScuderiaOS Project:**  
_Hi there! We developed "ScuderiaOS" for pure fun, and for the desire to have a great out-of-the-box distro._

* _Original stability of Debian 10!_
* _Optimized performance and Lightweight distro_
* _Xorg display server by default and not Wayland, which doesn't support greatly nvidia gpu cards._
* _Minor graphical fixes_
* _Integrated firewall, enabled by default, with custom rules and settings._
